# **Copycat Website Project**

The purpose of this project trying recreate existed website with HTML and CSS. Through out the procress, I finish the Pupilpath website mostly using `relative position`to align my content in the center. I did recreated the Pupilpath website but there is a lot of bug like **links don't work** so I start rework the project. My classmate taught me how important `<div>` is by teaching me how you could divide the content into different division and apply **CSS** to it. In the end, I did archieve the result that I want by using `<div>`, not overlying on `relative position`.
